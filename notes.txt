#Purpose:
This program is a docker container running Jenkins. It will have credentials and other setup tools installed within 
the container,(including plugins, example Dev users, etc.)

To run: 

Make sure port 7070 is open on the operating machine. Utilize the Makefile to start and stop this container

For the plugins, there's a new method of installing them:

Note, for the docker mount, you'll need to change the command when on a windows OS versus a 
linux
